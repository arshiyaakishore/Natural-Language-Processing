# Natural-Language-Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

### Key Components of NLP
1. Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
2. Part-of-Speech Tagging: Identifying the grammatical parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) in a sentence.
3. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.
4. Parsing: Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence to understand relationships between words.
5. Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text (positive, negative, neutral).
6. Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.
7. Text Classification: Assigning categories or labels to text based on its content.
8. Summarization: Automatically generating a concise summary of a longer piece of text.
9. Question Answering: Building systems that can answer questions posed in natural language.
10. Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text.
